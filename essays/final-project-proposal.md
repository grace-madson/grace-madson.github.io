## Idea: Microwave finder

If there is anything that I have been frustrated with this semester, it has been finding public microwaves on campus! I am sick and tired of packing cold lunches and not being able to find a microwave as a fairly new student. What is the solution? A microwave finder directory!
My current/previous campus has a website that keeps track of where the microwaves are on campus, but it is not regularly updated. The best way that I think to solve this (special sauce) would be to let students update this themselves. I have seen forums on reddit do this well, but it would nice to make it a website (with a moderator). Users can fill out a form, post a location

Some mockup pages for the site would include a homepage with quick links to access the directory, a map, images of microwaves, etc. There would be a few pages. One would be a directory listing building locations on campus and then room locations. You can click on each location to reveal more location details, a picture of the microwave in the space, etc. This can be as in depth or as minimal as possible.

The use case is fairly obvious: for students to have access to find microwaves on campus. Packing lunches is economical, but not everyone wants to eat a cold lunch. I know that this would help me a lot a student who packs a lunch to save money and wants to eat leftovers.

I think this could be expanded to not necesarily microwaves, but general facilities such as drinking fountains, accessibility facilities, bathrooms, fridges, and more. It would be like, the ultimate campus map! It could also include a feature to rate the location (such as cleanliness, accessibility, easy to find, etc)

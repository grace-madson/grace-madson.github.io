This project was created as a final project for the University of Minnesota course EE1301. The goal of the project was
to use the photon microcontroller and the Internet of Things (IoT) to create a project with the microcontroller. Our group
decided to create a plant monitoring system which included sensors to monitor temperature and moisture. All plant monitoring
information was available on "blink.io". From the site, one could also control a water pump, heating lamp, and 
cooling pad with a switch.
